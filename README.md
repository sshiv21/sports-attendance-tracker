Sports Attendance Tracker
Project Overview
The Sports Attendance Tracker is a web application designed to manage and track student attendance for sports activities. The system offers two interfaces: one for the captain and one for the student. It provides a user-friendly platform for captains to manage attendance records, and for students to view their attendance and request game changes. The project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL for efficient data handling and interface design.
